# RaspberryPi-MonitorTemp
MY IDEA:
I want to monitor temperature in server room with JianKongYi which has been deployed in DC.
I fix DTH11 with Pi, write Python code which can obtain temperature value and write into a log file.

JianKongYi(www.jiankongyi.com)

I also neet to install agent of "agent Linux" which is from JKY in Pi.

JKY will fetch the key words in status file.
