# RaspberryPi-MonitorTemp
MY IDEA:
I want to monitor temperature in server room with JianKongYi(www.jiankongyi.com) which has been deployed in DC.

I fix DTH11 with Pi, Pin1 connects to GPIO1 (BORAD), Pin2 connects to GPIO12, and Pin4 conencts to GPIO9.  

Write Python code which can obtain temperature value and write into a log file.

I also neet to install agent of "agent Linux" which is from JKY in Pi.

JKY will fetch the key words in log file.
